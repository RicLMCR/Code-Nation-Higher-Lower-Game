# Code-Nation-Higher-Lower-Game
My submission for group project whilst at Code Nation academy. Each team member aimed to submit a short game, coded in Python, for an imaginary gameshow. My contribution was a short take on that well-known chestnut - the Higher/Lower game.
Kudos to my Team-mate Pauola who came up with the print-delay function.
